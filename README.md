# My Nvim Configuration
Inspired by [LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim).

## TODO
- Global settings used to overwrite configuration easily.
- Rewrite `TerminalToggle` with lua, which should auto close when target win is closed.
- Clean colorscheme, which shoule support `barbar` and `galaxyline`.
- Maybe use `dashboard`.
